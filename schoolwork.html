      <p>Our kitchen is where my family and I spend a majority our time eating and enjoying each other’s company. My mom makes the meals and the atmosphere in the room is breezy and conversational. In the kitchen cupboards, you’ll find plates, silverware, cups, and cooking utensils galore. In the fridge you’ll find vegetables, eggs, meat, and condiments a plenty. And in the pantry there are plenty of spices, pastas, cooking oils, breads, and such. But my favorite part of the kitchen is a drawer located next to the fridge containing the cookbooks. Believe me, I do enjoy the yummy home cooked meals that my mom makes, but sometimes she needs to kick it up a notch and whip up something new.

		<p>I wander into the kitchen on a breezy Summer afternoon to find my mom browsing through what I believe is the holy grail of all cookbooks, In The Kitchen With Kris: A Kollection of Kardashian-Jenner Family Favorites. “What are you in the mood for,” she asks. I sit beside her and we look through the book together? I’ve already flipped the book dozens of times, but it never gets old. Reading through the cookbook’s almost 70 recipes and endless anecdotes, I find myself in awe. These exact recipes have become the centerpiece of Kardashian-Jenner family dinners and I love how my family can enjoy them too. Inside the book you’ll also find family photos scattered tying into the backstory of the recipe. Because as Kris describes it, “It’s much more than food. It’s legacy. It’s love.”
